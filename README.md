Simulate the thermal properties of Heisenberg models on the maple-leaf lattice using iPEPS method. The implementation makes use of the U(1) symmetry using the iTensor library.

The imaginary time evolution is performed with the simple update-scheme. Additional files that can help implement the full-update scheme is provided in the fullupdate folder.
